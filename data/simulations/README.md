Simulation Data
===============

Spikes produced during neural network simulations. Data is stored as a bzip2'd tar archive, split into pieces.

Unpack the data by running:

```
cat spikedata.tar.bz2.part* | tar xjvf -
```

Or, in a Windows environment:

```
copy /b spikedata.tar.bz2.part* spikedata.tar.bz2
```

Then use your favorite bzip2-aware archiver to extract the files.
